*Do you know that our brain works logarithmically?*

1. Do this exercise: 
    - Draw a number line
    - Mark $0$ and $1,000,000,000$ on the line. 
    - Ask yourself a question: where is $1,000$? 
2. Many people put $1,000$ at the $1/3$ position. Note that $1,000=10^3$, $1,000,000,000=10^9$, where $9$ is triple of $3$. This implies that we perceive number logarithmically!
3. Not only **size** of a number, but also **weight** of an object, **loudness** of a sound, **brightness** of a star, **spiciness** of a chili, all of these are perceived logarithmically by the human brain.
4. Such logarithmic law is known more than 100 years ago, under the name "[**Weber-Fechner law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law)" in psychophysics.
