    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="/blog/2021/03/04/your-one-big-desire">previous post</a> I talked about anxiety caused by things that you actually have control over. This time I’d like to also touch on situations that you can’t really change, such as a pandemic.</p>

<p>A pandemic makes people anxious because it freezes life. A lot of activities have to be suspended. You can’t do what you would normally do. You don’t know how long the pandemic would last — probably a few months, probably a few years. All you can do is wait, indefinitely.</p>

<h3 id="mathematicians-in-confinement">Mathematicians in confinement</h3>

<p>Some groups of people seem to be doing quite well in a lockdown situation. Mathematicians happen to be one such group.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Sophus Lie, who established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra">Lie algebra</a> during his imprisonment, said that “a mathematician is comparatively well suited to be in prison.” And Lie was not alone, 70 years later another great mathematician, André Weil, who also had a productive time in prison, wondered “if it’s only in prison that I work so well, will I have to arrange to spend two or three months locked up every year?”</p>

<p>According to the fun article <a href="http://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2020-21-2-095.pdf"><em>Lockdown Mathematics</em></a>, both Lie and Weil were mistaken for spies during wartimes “due to their strange habits as eccentric mathematicians who incessantly scribbled some sort of incomprehensible notes and wandered in nature without any credible purpose discernible to outsiders.”</p>

<p>There are many other interesting examples from that article. The bottom line is, many mathematicians have experienced highly productive periods during confinement situations, where they were free of distractions and could focus deeply on their thoughts; although in some cases, this effect only lasted for a month or two, eventually the productivity boost waned. After all, mathematicians are still humans who need some breaks.</p>

<p>I have to say that the above description perfectly summarized my experience during the COVID lockdown. I was super productive and wrote two papers during the first few months of the lockdown, then I started to get distracted and wanted to socialize again.</p>

<p>Now it is March again, an anniversary of the COVID lockdown in the US. Maybe I could also benefit from setting up a few months of faux lockdown for myself every year.</p>

<h3 id="flow-vs-pandemic">Flow v.s. Pandemic</h3>

<p>According to some <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242043">recent research</a>, getting in the state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> might be one best way to cope with lockdown anxieties. When you are experiencing flow, you are deeply focused on something; time seems to slip by quickly, a few hours feel like just a moment to you.</p>

<p>Not just mathematicians, other people find their flow in all sorts of ways: painting, making handicrafts, reading books, writing essays, coding. So when you get into flow, not only that time passes much quicker, but you are also accomplishing something meaningful to you. It just completely flips the lockdown situation around and gives you a positive experience.</p>

<p>In fact, this experience may have deeper implications if we redefine “pandemic” as a state of mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A “pandemic” is an extended period during which you are constantly anxious about one thing that you can’t control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this definition, people are constantly undergoing all kinds of pandemics: losing jobs, struggling to graduate, accumulating debts, being homesick, feeling lonely. In each of these cases, people are stuck in a “personal pandemic” that they can’t easily escape and have to live with it for an uncertain amount of time.</p>

<p>Inspired by the lockdown experience, maybe one solution to a “personal pandemic” is to accept it like we accepted that we would be living under COVID for a few years, and turn to focus on something we truly care about. Oftentimes, the consequence of a “personal pandemic” is not as dire as one might think it would be; a threat might also be an opportunity for growth. So being able to find your flow could carry you through the most difficult time of your “personal pandemic,” giving you the chance to come out stronger and better off.</p>

    <updated>2021-03-04T23:23:03-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://bobbielf2.github.io/blog/2021/03/04/your-one-big-desire</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anxiety comes from desire. You are anxious when you desire something but not sure if you can get it.</p>

<h4 id="linear-independence-of-desires">Linear Independence of Desires</h4>

<p>I’d like to see different desires as being <em>linearly independent</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Linearity.</strong> When you have many desires, they “superpose” to increase your level of anxiety. For example, if someone wants to be rich, be famous, to have a superb partner, and to be playing all day and not have to work … all at the same time, then this must be the most anxious person in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Independence.</strong> Whether or not one desire is satisfied doesn’t affect your ability to satisfy another desire. For example, you don’t have to be rich to start doing things you like, you don’t have to be gorgeous to start building a good relationship, you don’t have to be the most intelligent person to be confident.</p>

<p>As a corollary, if you just give up most of your desires, you will stop being overly anxious and have much more energy to persue your most important desire.</p>

<!--more-->

<h4 id="pick-one-desire-and-enjoy-life">Pick One Desire and Enjoy Life</h4>

<p>My last year of PhD was an incredible year for me. But I actually failed to graduate the year before. I spent some hard time with myself in the summer and decided that I would try to achieve one big goal in my final year: to graduate as a <em>competent</em> scholar. I picked this goal because I wouldn’t be satisfied with <em>just</em> graduating and then spend my time working on some random job just to get by. I truely hoped to still be able to enjoy doing creative work after graduation.</p>

<p>To achieve this goal, my logic was plain and simple: I need to be productive to be competent for my work; I need to be healthy to be productive. So I started eating healthier and exercising more regularly.</p>

<p>Interestingly, as I became a healthier person, I also began to enjoy life. Over the year, besides focusing on my work, I also had a very supportive relationship and became a more grateful person, which in turn made me a more confident person and helped me build new connections. In the end, I had not only graduated, but also delivered a speech at the commencement and found a job I liked which allowed me to continue to do creative work.</p>

<p>I am sure a lot of these results were just luck, but it was fascinating how the world seemed to be coordinating to send me through an upward spiral.</p>

<p>I have learned two things from this experience:<br />
(1) I don’t really need a lot of grit or perseverance to achieve something. All I need to do is let go of all the other desires, then I have plenty of mental power to work on the one big thing.<br />
(2) Letting go of other desires doesn’t mean I won’t be doing all those things. It just means that I don’t see them as “goals.” For example, I was eating healthy food and exercising regularly only because I enjoyed them, I didn’t have to do them if I thought they made me feel worse.</p>

<h4 id="your-one-big-desire">Your One Big Desire</h4>

<p>There was one quote that I thought was very beautiful but which had never really believed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was from the fiction <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel)"><em>The Alchemist</em></a> by Paulo Coello. Behind this quote was one of the most romantic stories I have ever read. So romantic that I never thought reality would work that way.</p>

<p>However, since then I have had this “something” that I truely wanted for a few times (although each time it lasted only for a year or two). Each time I made up my mind, I had this peculiar feeling that the world did seem to be helping me out in unexpected ways. These experiences had pushed me to read between the lines. I am realizing that maybe this “something” in the quote has to be singular. It must be the one thing that you absolutely want during that period of your life, from which you won’t get distracted by anything else. In a world full of uncertainties, this one desire can be the very certainty that guides you through chaos and doubts.</p>

<p>What is the one desire that is truely important to you? It is okay that you are anxious about that one and only that one.</p>

    <link href="http://bobbielf2.github.io/blog/2021/02/22/one-disastrous-week-in-austin/"/>
    <updated>2021-02-22T01:51:51-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://bobbielf2.github.io/blog/2021/02/22/one-disastrous-week-in-austin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>80+ hours. I can’t remember the last time I have been without power at subzero temperature for this long.</p>

<p>Austin (and Texas) just went through a disaster. A winter storm devoured the city, turning it into a frozen world for a week. On Monday, January 15, 2021, temperature dropped below -10°C, coldest over the past century. Snow was thick enough to sink your entire boots in. While such cold weather is nothing special in northern states like Michigan, it is nothing the Texans have ever seen. The electricity infrastructures in Texas were absolutely unprepared for such extreme condition, leaving millions of people out of power throughout the week.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am one of the witnesses and sufferers in this historic event. To make things worse, both of the kitchen stove and hot water in my apartment rely on electricity, so we are out of every possible source of energy.</p>

<p>Long story short, we survived. And here is how.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>First of all, I am thankful to have been staying with my girlfriend this year. The support and encouragement we provide to each other is the most important reason that we stayed positive and endured this hardship. It is true that a long-term relationship compounds its value over time and can be your lifesaver in unexpected events.</p>

<p>Second of all, getting helps from our neighbors was the silver lining during the week. After a day without power and heat, I started asking around for help on my phone. Eventually, I was connected to a friend’s friend who lived nearby and was fortunate enough to still have power in their building. It was also important that we could just walk there because you don’t want to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/fort-worth-wreck.html">drive on icy roads</a> in such weather. So from Wednesday on, we could have something hot to eat for lunch and bring some hot water home. I sent food pictures to my family far away so that they knew I was doing fine.</p>

<p>Preparation also made a difference. We stocked up some food before the week because we paid attention to the weather forecast. This turned out to be one of our best decisions because later in the week we didn’t have to stand in the cold in long lines outside of HEB. Ironically, the freezing temperature helped preserve our food during the week-long power outage.</p>

<p>Daily activities became simple. We went to bed before 9 PM because there is nothing much you can do in a cold dark night. We had more than 12 hours of sleep every day to save energy and stay warm. During the day, when we were not busy surviving, we spent most of our time reading which distracted us from the frigid reality. I also did exercises and lifted weights at home, which I think is an acceptable compromise for my <a href="/blog/2021/01/02/making-small-changes-in-life/">365-day challenge</a> since it was unsafe to be running outside.</p>

<p>The weather warmed up towards the weekend, finally above freezing on Friday. Our building got its electricity back on Friday afternoon and it had been more than 80 hours since we lost power.</p>

<p>Looking back, I think it is equally important to survive both the physical and mental challenges. I can’t imagine what it would be like if I were enduring all this all by myself and had no one to talk to. Staying calm and positive during a hard time can make a huge difference. Once you have hope, the physical challenges look easier to defeat. I wish everybody who suffered the power outage during this brutal week had found someone they can reach out to.</p>

<p>As the driving condition was improved, we went to stay at our friends’ house during the weekend. Because of COVID, it’s been a long time since we could spend a day or two with people we care about. I feel grateful that a harsh situation like this became the best opportunity to bond again.</p>

    <updated>2021-02-14T22:23:50-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://bobbielf2.github.io/blog/2021/02/14/underestimating-my-ignorance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“Being ignorant is bad.” So would most people think. I try hard to be more knowledgeable and I am still ashamed of my own ignorance oftentimes. But I am also learning more and more about the positive power of ignorance — a power that has been underestimated.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Thanks to last year’s COVID lockdown, I had the chance to concentrate on research without distractions. I was fortunate enough to make some discoveries, which I thought was a huge breakthrough. After submitting some papers, a few months later I found out that I have in fact overlooked some closely related work in the literature. One of my results looked less great given the existing work, although it was still a nice progress.</p>

<p>While this has been a humbling experience, it was also inspiring: I wouldn’t have been so optimistic if I knew how long a journey the pioneers have traveled; I might have lost my faith and given up early if I knew all the failed attempts by other people. It was exactly my ignorance that had given me the courage to attack the open problems and the hope to keep pushing. Luckily, I eventually bumped into paths and territories that others have overlooked which led to my destination.</p>

<p>As Alain Connes once wrote, the initial phase of making new math discoveries “requires a kind of protection of one’s ignorance.” Sometimes, ignorance “frees people from reverence for authority and allows them to rely on their intuition.” In the same spirit, Steve Jobs also told people to “stay hungry, stay foolish.” Perhaps all intellectuals, including academics and industrial innovators, can use some protections of ignorance.</p>

<p>We like to be well-prepared before going into a challenging adventure. But knowing all the failed journeys of other people, knowing that even some brave and strong peers had failed their missions, can actually paralyse you into inaction. In fact, exploring the math world doesn’t require your having “full knowledge” about any field. Nobody ever knew “enough.” Once you know a minimum amount of knowledge that allows you to survive, you can start your journey.</p>

<p>“Whatever the origin of one’s journey, one day, if one walks far enough, one is bound to stumble on a well-known town: for instance, elliptic functions, modular forms, or zeta functions.” This is another quote from Alain Connes, which resonates with me deeply. There is no single path to knowledge, we can be free to explore our own paths and not be ashamed of knowing too little about all other possible paths. Be brave and keep pushing, once in a while we will meet with other adventurers in one of those famous mathematical towns.</p>

    <link href="http://bobbielf2.github.io/blog/2021/01/17/reaction-and-creation-are-antonyms/"/>
    <updated>2021-01-17T20:06:52-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://bobbielf2.github.io/blog/2021/01/17/reaction-and-creation-are-antonyms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>… and anagrams. (How cute!)</p>

<h3 id="the-reactionary-approach">The Reactionary Approach</h3>

<p>The reactionary approach seems to be a default setting of human behavior: people react only when something undesirable happens. Consequently, people have to react every single time something undesirable happens. This is apparently so in politics (especially prominent in 2020). But you can observe reactionary behaviors in all other domains.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>For example, parents and teachers often react against technology. It’s quite typical to hear things like “Turn off the video game!” or “Put down your phone!” or “No electronics in class!”</p>

<p>Another common example is doing presentations. Now that most presentations are done with slides, you can find a lot of reactionary advice such as “Don’t put everything on one slide” or “Don’t include irrelavant pictures or animations” or “Don’t use illegible fancy fonts.”</p>

<p>Taking a reactionary approach is totally fine when the problem you are dealing with is simple (like replenishing your toilet paper) or a one-off thing (like repairing a flat tire). For more complex and constantly evolving problems, such as education and technology, taking a reactionary approach is like playing a never-ending whac-a-mole game: you banned gaming, they turned to their phones; you banned phones, they turned to weed and drugs. It never solves the real problem. It is exhausting and can be harmful to your relationships. Maybe we can take a more systematic approach.</p>

<h3 id="the-creationary-approach">The Creationary Approach</h3>

<p>What makes me happy is that more and more creative people are taking on the task of improving education with technology.</p>

<p>An early example is the Khan Academy. Khan started by making videos to teach some of the school classes online. This seemingly simple approach enables what’s called the self-paced learning: instead of being forced to sit and listen in class, students can pick their own time to watch the videos; instead of feeling embarrassed to ask questions, students can just replay the part where they were lost. The traditional way of learning is to attend lectures in class and do the homework after. But with the video lectures, students can now watch them at home and do the homework in class (i.e., tutoring). Learning becomes more engaging and more human.</p>

<p>This is what I’d like to call a <strong>creationary approach</strong>. I see “reactionary” and “creationary” as antonyms (and they are anagrams!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reactionary approach is to react against something only when an undesirable result happens.</li>
  <li>A creationary approach is to create something so that desirable results can happen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the past decades, I am seeing more and more creationary people teaching math creatively with the help of technology. Just to name a few of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Burkard Polster (channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg">Mathologer</a>) is an engaging story-teller. He presents interesting maths that are not taught in school, which can really broaden your view.</li>
  <li>Grant Sanderson (channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a>) created a <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">math animation engine</a> to make inspiring animations that introduce cool maths to a general audience.</li>
  <li>Cliff Stoll (appeared many times on the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt5AfwLFPxWJeBhzCJ_JXdaIXi_YJl7Bh">Numberphile</a>), among many other creative things, has made strange pieces of glassware to teach topology. (He is also a <a href="https://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1981970&amp;cid=35112450">creative science teacher</a>. I highly recommend listening to his <a href="https://youtu.be/lxdcBD4ppF0">interview</a> with the Numberphile.)</li>
  <li>The recent <a href="https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/">Computational Thinking</a> course is a collaboration between MIT and the Julia Programming community. It is a terrific attempt to push the limit of distance learning during the pandemic.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is people like these who have given me a lot of hope and excitement about the future of education.</p>

<h3 id="be-creationary">Be Creationary</h3>

<p>In our daily life, we often run into a whac-a-mole lifestyle, too. People go on a diet to lose weight multiple times a year. People try to quit smoking many times in their life. People are making the same New Year Resolutions every year.</p>

<p>To take a creationary approach to life means to make choices based on what you are <em>for</em> rather than what you are <em>against</em>.</p>

<p>One trick I often use is to create connections between the things I love doing with the things I think I should do. For example, I enjoy doing exercises because I love listening to podcasts at the same time. I enjoy eating healthy because healthy foods are delicious and it allows me to focus on my research problems for longer without getting fatigue easily. Once these connections become my habits and instincts, doing the “hard” thing feels effortless.</p>

<p>Of course, taking a creationary approach is hard. It is not always easy to know what you are for; it can be very hard to find your purpose; being creative may not always give you the desired result. But I also believe that creativity is something that you can train for: be aware that you can always choose creation over reaction, allow yourself more chances to experiment and to fail, learn from creative people and enjoy their company. Sooner or later, you will encounter your own serendipity.</p>
