  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you begin to research a field of study, you often get overwhelmed by the amount of existing knowledge you have to learn before you could go further. One useful way to bootstrap yourself is to only learn a minimal amount of basic ideas that are enough for you to “survive”  in the field. Such basic ideas are the Minimal Actionable Knowledge &amp; Experience (MAKE) of the field. Here, I will try to present the “MAKE” of the field of fast matrix computations.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the <a href="/blog/2021/03/04/your-one-big-desire">previous post</a> I talked about anxiety caused by things that you actually have control over. This time I’d like to also touch on situations that you can’t really change, such as a pandemic.</p>

<p>A pandemic makes people anxious because it freezes life. A lot of activities have to be suspended. You can’t do what you would normally do. You don’t know how long the pandemic would last — probably a few months, probably a few years. All you can do is wait, indefinitely.</p>

<h3 id="mathematicians-in-confinement">Mathematicians in confinement</h3>

<p>Some groups of people seem to be doing quite well in a lockdown situation. Mathematicians happen to be one such group.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anxiety comes from desire. You are anxious when you desire something but not sure if you can get it.</p>

<h4 id="linear-independence-of-desires">Linear Independence of Desires</h4>

<p>I’d like to see different desires as being <em>linearly independent</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Linearity.</strong> When you have many desires, they “superpose” to increase your level of anxiety. For example, if someone wants to be rich, be famous, to have a superb partner, and to be playing all day and not have to work … all at the same time, then this must be the most anxious person in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Independence.</strong> Whether or not one desire is satisfied doesn’t affect your ability to satisfy another desire. For example, you don’t have to be rich to start doing things you like, you don’t have to be gorgeous to start building a good relationship, you don’t have to be the most intelligent person to be confident.</p>

<p>As a corollary, if you just give up most of your desires, you will stop being overly anxious and have much more energy to persue your most important desire.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>80+ hours. I can’t remember the last time I have been without power at subzero temperature for this long.</p>

<p>Austin (and Texas) just went through a disaster. A winter storm devoured the city, turning it into a frozen world for a week. On Monday, January 15, 2021, temperature dropped below -10°C, coldest over the past century. Snow was thick enough to sink your entire boots in. While such cold weather is nothing special in northern states like Michigan, it is nothing the Texans have ever seen. The electricity infrastructures in Texas were absolutely unprepared for such extreme condition, leaving millions of people out of power throughout the week.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am one of the witnesses and sufferers in this historic event. To make things worse, both of the kitchen stove and hot water in my apartment rely on electricity, so we are out of every possible source of energy.</p>

<p>Long story short, we survived. And here is how.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Potential theory was developed a few centuries ago in part to solve the boundary value problems for partial differential equations (PDEs). It led to the so-called “indirect approach” to boundary integral equations for elliptic PDEs. The goal of this article is to give this indirect approach some physical meaning. Some basic knowledge of potential theory is assumed. (See the book by R. Kress<sup id="fnref:kress"><a href="#fn:kress" class="footnote">1</a></sup> for more details.)</p>

<p>Consider the classical Laplace equation in a domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, with Dirichlet boundary condition on the boundary $\Gamma:=\partial\Omega$, written as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta u(x) &= 0 & x\in\Omega\\
u(x) &= f(x) & x\in\Gamma
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>The theory of integral equations solves a given boundary value problem like this by reformulating it into an integral equation on the boundary of the domain, such that the 2D <em>spatial differential problem</em> in $\Omega$ is reduced to a 1D <em>boundary integral problem</em> on $\Gamma$.</p>

<p>There are two main approaches to integral equations: the <em>direct approach</em> and the <em>indirect approach</em>.</p>

<p>One key ingredient of public communication is to know your audience well. I would like to propose a visual model that can be helpful for adjusting your presentation based on the type of your audience.</p>

<p>I call this model the <em>Audience Lightcone</em>:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Pareto principle (a.k.a. 80/20 rule) says that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. Qualitatively speaking, this also applies to numerical integration: most of the integral can be handled by just a few quadrature rules.</p>

<p>People who have learned numerical analysis all know about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_quadrature">Gauss quadrature</a> rule: for any integer $n&gt;0$, there exist $n$ nodes $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\in[-1,1]$ and $n$ corresponding weights $w_1,w_2,\dots,w_n$, such that the approximation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_{-1}^1f(x)\,dx\approx \sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i)w_i</script>

<p>is highly accurate for any function $f$ smoothly defined on $[-1,1]$. The error of this approximation typically decays exponentially as $n$ increases. Together with scaling and shifting of variables, the Gauss quadrature efficiently handles all the regular integrals (i.e. integrals involving smooth integrands) on any interval $[a,b]\subset\mathbb{R}$.</p>

<p>What if the integrand is singular? How would you approximate an integral when the integrand is not smooth or even blowing up somewhere on the interval? It turns out that most of the singular integrals in practice can be handled by a few strategies (80/20 rule again!). Here they are:</p>

<h3 id="the-reactionary-approach">The Reactionary Approach</h3>

<p>The reactionary approach seems to be a default setting of human behavior: people react only when something undesirable happens. Consequently, people have to react every single time something undesirable happens. This is apparently so in politics (especially prominent in 2020). But you can observe reactionary behaviors in all other domains.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Y Combinator (YC) is a startup incubator that had launched many successful companies including Airbnb, Coinbase, Dropbox, Reddit, etc. YC’s founder Paul Graham wrote an inspiring article, “<a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">Do Things That Don’t Scale</a>,” that gives solid advice to startup founders on what they should focus on when starting a business. I find it interesting that when I read the article through the lens of academia, Graham’s advice appears to also be useful for people heading into an academic career, such as myself.</p>

<p>I have noticed that there are a lot of similarities between building a startup company and building an academic career:</p>
